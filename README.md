# OptiKey Hardware Control (experimental version)  

OptiKey is an on-screen keyboard that is designed to help Motor Neuron Disease (MND) patients interact with Windows computers. When used with an eye-tracking device, OptiKey's on-screen keyboard allows MND patients to complete tasks, such as email composition, using only their eyes. OptiKey can also be used with a mouse or webcam. Unlike expensive and unreliable Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) products that are difficult to use, Optikey is free, reliable, and easy to use.

# This version in development will allow to include external hardware control functions,must be used under your own responsibility, without any warranty by the programmers and hardware suppliers, if a malfunction of the system or failure results in a loss or damage to health or material, of the person using it or a third person.


# What can be done with Optikey HC?

- Operate devices with infrared remote control input.
- Send control signals to home automation devices that support WIFI or wired control, via UDP or TCP connections.
- Control your own Arduino-based devices.
